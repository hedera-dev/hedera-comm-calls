## HIP-991: Permissionless Revenue-Generating Topic IDs for Topic Operators

- **Presenter**: Michael Kantor
- **Status**: Council Review
- **Summary**:
  - This HIP proposes the creation of permissionless, revenue-generating Topic IDs for Topic Operators on the Hedera network.
  - Details were presented during the last call, where the key features and motivations were discussed.
  - The goal is to allow Topic Operators to earn revenue directly from the use of their Topic IDs, thus incentivizing more decentralized and permissionless participation in the network.
  - This HIP aims to enhance the economic model around topic-based messaging on Hedera, making it more appealing for operators to participate.
  - The proposed change does not introduce breaking changes, but rather adds an optional revenue generation layer for topic operators.
