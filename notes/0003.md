## HIP-1037: Protocol Buffer Specification

- **Presenter**: Joseph Sinclair
- **Status**: Draft
- **Author**: Joseph Sinclair
  - **GitHub**: [jsync-swirlds](https://github.com/jsync-swirlds)
  - **Affiliation**: Hashgraph
- **Summary**:
  - Whenever you communicate (directly) with  Hedera nodes, you do so using the HAPI protocol.
  - The message format is defined using protocol buffers.
  -  Many lower level HIPs specify the protocol buffers that they use.
  - HIP-1037 proposes making the code files for these protocol buffers contain specifications + documentation.
  - This means that we get a single source of truth, and that specs/ docs can be programmatically generated.
