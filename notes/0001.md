### HIP-980

- Presenter: Ivan Kavaldzhiev
- Extend mirror node APIs with timestamp query
- Non-breaking change, simply a new query param
- Can fetch certain historical data (that was not previously possible)
- Currently on Hedera, you cannot do a "shallow fork" of a public network
- When this HIP is implemented, that paves the way (pre-requisite) for this to happen
- This opens up new possibilities with developer tools
  - Debug/ inspect workflows... against actual state on a public network
  - Integration with existing EVM dev tools possible
- Will be added to 6 existing mirror node APIs
- When timestamp isn't specified, it will default to "now", and so is backwards compatible

## HIP-850

- Presenter: Michael Kantor
- Was written by Patches 2 years ago
- Similar to HIP-657, but this takes it a step further
- Main thing: Metadata on older token IDs can be updated, but must be signed by the supply key
- So it this is backwards compatible with older HIPs
- Unlocks several ne possibilities: In games, art
- Can be combined with Hashinals, which was previously the only way to make dynamic NFTs

- The TierBot inscription portal for creating Hashinals - https://tier.bot/inscribe
  - "Will be adding the ability to swap metadata with HIP-850 and HIP-657 soon as well" - Michael

## HIP-920

- Most NFTs are art (visual), not music (audio)
- If there's no standards for music metadata, that makes it difficult to give users a consistent experience -  instead they have a fragmented
- Builds on HIP-412
- Opportunity to tap into web2 apps by connecting to them
- Music Brainz schema - it is very very complex
- This effort spun out from the Hashgraph NFT working group
- Informational HIP - does not change anything about the network functionality
- There are proofs of concept - Hello Future single
- TuneFM and Turtle moon - platforms adopting this HIP as a standard
